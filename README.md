# Python-Project

This Python data analysis project focuses on exploring an air traffic passenger dataset with a target column labeled "GEO Summary," categorizing flights as either "International" or "Domestic." The project's objective is to discern the determinants influencing the classification of flights into these categories. By examining features within the dataset, such as origin, destination, flight duration, and airline information, the project aims to identify patterns and trends associated with international and domestic flights. Ultimately, the analysis seeks to provide insights into the factors driving the classification of flights as either international or domestic, thereby contributing to a better understanding of airline operations and passenger dynamics.

TARGET COLUMN == GEO Summary
GEO Summary "International" :- International Flights.
GEO Summary "Domastic" :-Domastic Flights.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project aims to uncover the factors contributing to GEO Summary. Through analysis of various dataset features, we seek to understand their impact International and Domastic Flights on Airline.
